## Compile

### CMake 
The code can be compiled with cmake. Pass GTEST or BOOST to compile also tests with Google test suite or with the Boost library.

Tests are only to check *functionalities*, not to check performances. 


### Makefile
Otherwise the code can be simply compiled using the Makefile.
